In this chapter I have refreshed my knowledge of the basics for HTML.
I have also learned how to use Visual Studios and a nice shortcut for adding
the "backbone".

To add to this, I have had some useful practice on using the terminal, as this
part is quite new. I have gotten more used to working with git and I am
looking forward to making it the best place it can be.

The most important things I used were:
- git add, git commit and git push
- ! in Visual Studios
- code in the terminal

Things I want to do better in the future:
- Get used to adding stuff to github some more. There was a moment that my 
system froze and I was affraid to lose all my work (I didn't).
- use Google more for questions.
